# Tiny Web Server Refactoring

![](./assets/server-refactoring.png)

In this exercise we are going to study and refactor the code of a tiny Web Server that uses the built-in `node:os` module to return system information back to the user. Our aim is to detect parts of the code that can be improved and detect any [`code smells`](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CodeSmell.html) that can be removed.

> _"A code smell is a surface indication that usually corresponds to a deeper problem in the system."_ ~ Martin Fowler

## Here's the plan...

1) First, let's start by watching a series of short videos from `Jacob Sorber` on `Code Smells`:

  - 1.1) [Smelly code and long functions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ll4XT0MYKN0){:target="_blank"}
  - 1.2) [Smelly code and bad names](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zx7euEEZ0H4){:target="_blank"}
  - 1.3) [Code Smells: Duplicate Code (DRY)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ck_RfVOYgjQ){:target="_blank"}
  - 1.4) [Smelly code and Magic Numbers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8RC_i9t0MU){:target="_blank"}

  This will take you around 20 minutes. After you've finished watching these videos, take a piece of paper and write down what you've learned in the form of a checklist.
