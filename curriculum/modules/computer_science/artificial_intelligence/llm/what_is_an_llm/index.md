### Study Plan

  **What is a `Large Language Model` (or LLM for short)?**

  Go through the following material to learn more about LLMs and get a basic understanding of what an LLM is and how it works:

  - [What are Large Language Models (LLMs)?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iR2O2GPbB0E){:target="_blank"} (YouTube: 6min)

  - [Introduction to Large Language Models (LLMs)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibr5wmtinG0){:target="_blank"} (YouTube: 8min)

  - [How does ChatGPT work? Explained by Deep-Fake Ryan Gosling.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xU_MFS_ACrU){:target="_blank"} (YouTube: 9min)

  - [LLM Explained \| What is LLM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67_aMPDk2zw){:target="_blank"} (YouTube: 4min)

  **Why not let an LLM explain what an LLM is?**

  Visit [this page](/curriculum/modules/computer_science/artificial_intelligence/llm/experimental-phi3-webgpu/index.html){:target="_blank"}, load the `Phi3` LLM model (**warning it's going to download around 2.4GB on your machine**, but this is a one-time only thing) and start asking questions. For example, you can ask:
  
  - `What is a Large Language Model?`
  - `How does an LLM work?`
  - `Can you explain what a Large Language Model is to a non-technical person?`
