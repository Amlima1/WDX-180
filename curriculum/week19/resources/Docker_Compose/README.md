# Docker Compose

*From July 2023 Compose V1 stopped receiving updates. It's also no longer available in new releases of Docker Desktop. Compose V2 is included with all currently supported versions of Docker Desktop.*

## What is docker compose

Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your application's services. Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration.

Compose works in all environments; production, staging, development, testing, as well as CI workflows. It also has commands for managing the whole lifecycle of your application:

- Start, stop, and rebuild services
- View the status of running services
- Stream the log output of running services
- Run a one-off command on a service
