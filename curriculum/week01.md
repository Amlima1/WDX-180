### Week 1 - Day 2 - How the Internet & the World Wide Web works

#### Study Plan

Watch the following videos from the [How the Internet Works](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzdnOPI1iJNfMRZm5DDxco3UdsFegvuB7) YouTube Playlist.

In total, the duration of these videos is around 58min, which means that it will probably take you 1.5x to 2x times the time (90min~120min) to go through them, keep notes and questions and re-watch parts that were hard to grasp.

For every single resources, make sure to keep notes, write down questions about parts of the content that seem unclear or difficult to grasp and update the progress Google Sheet accordingly.
