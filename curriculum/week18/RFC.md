# Node JS Full Course
The course below is based on [Dave Gray](https://github.com/gitdagray)'s tutorial on YouTube called [Node.js Full Course for Beginners | Complete All-in-One Tutorial | 7 Hours
](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2EqECiTBL8)

It's broken down into not longer than 1 hour videos, through 2 weeks, in order to fully understand and have time to practice each new skill presented in those videos. By the end of this course, you will be able to setup your own personal web server using NodeJS, ExpressJS, MongoDB and a front-end framework of your choice (preferably React).

This web server will be able to handle REST requests, User Authentication/Authorization and CRUD Operations altering any data model of your choice!
