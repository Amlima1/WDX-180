# Test your skills: Writing modes and logical properties

_(Updated: 08/09/2023)_

The aim of this skill test is to assess whether you understand how to [handle different text directions using writing modes and logical properties in CSS](../../resources/css_building_blocks/handling_different_text_directions/README.md).

> **Note:** If you get stuck, then ask us for help!

## Task 1

In this task, the box is displayed with a horizontal writing mode. Can you add a line of CSS to change it so it uses a vertical writing mode with right to left text?

[Download the starting point for this task](assets/writing-mode-download.html) to work in your own editor or in an online editor.

Your final result should look like the image below:

## Task 2

In this task, we want you to use logical properties to replace `width` and `height` in order to maintain the aspect ratio of the box as it is turned vertically.

Your final result should look like the image below:

## Task 3

In this task, we want you to use logical versions of the margin, border, and padding properties so that the edges of the box relate to the text rather than following top, left, bottom and right.

Your final result should look like the image below:
