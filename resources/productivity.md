# Learning and Productivity Tips

___"Truth flourishes where the student's lamp has shone,<br>
And there alone,"___, W.B. Yeats

## Study*

_*from latin **Studium**, meaning **zeal, painstaking application, dedication**._

- When learning new concepts, ensure that you **always accompany them with imagery**. For example, when learning about `closures` in JavaScript, google for `closure javascript` and switch to `Images` search mode to find useful diagrams, images, charts or any other type of imagery that will help you "connect" with the concept you are trying to learn and get a visual representation that will help you build a strong mental model behind each concept. There is a great deal of scientific research and studies that confirm [the important role of visual input in processing and retaining information](../teaching/README.md#dual-coding-theory--picture-superiority-effect).

- **YouTube Videos:** 

  - **Switch to a different playback speed:** if you feel the default speed (1x) is either too fast or too slow for you. You can configure the playback speed by clicking the `Settings` icon and then selecting a `Playback Speed`. Speeds over 1 (1.25, 1.5, etc.) will accelerate the playback rate, while speed values under 0 (0.75, 0.5, etc.) will slow down the video and audio.

  - **Use an AdBlocker:** you are probably going to need an AdBlocker while watching YouTube videos, as it can become really distracting (not to mention annoying and time consuming) watching ads popping up all of the time. You can install something like [Adblock Plus - free ad blocker](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/adblock-plus-free-ad-bloc/cfhdojbkjhnklbpkdaibdccddilifddb) for Chrome.

  - **Check the comments section**: for additional feedback, outdated content, errata and extra information that might be helpful. Look for comments that mention that the content is outdated or contains misleading information. **Tip:** you can install the Chrome extension [SummifyYT](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/summifyyt-summarize-youtu/mcjgidambippeaajehcfimmephgholco) which does a pretty good job reading all the comments and summarizing the overall feedback _(see screenshot below)_.
