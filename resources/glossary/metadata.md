**Metadata** is — in its very simplest definition — data that describes data. For example, an [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTML) document is data, but HTML can also contain metadata in its [`<head>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/head) element that describes the document — for example who wrote it, and its summary.
