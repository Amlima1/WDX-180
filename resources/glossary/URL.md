**Uniform Resource Locator** (**URL**) is a text string that specifies where a resource (such as a web page, image, or video) can be found on the Internet.

In the context of {{Glossary("HTTP")}}, URLs are called "Web address" or "link". Your {{glossary("browser")}} displays URLs in its address bar, for example: `https://developer.mozilla.org` Some browsers display only the part of a URL after the "//", that is, the {{Glossary("Domain name")}}.

URLs can also be used for file transfer ({{Glossary("FTP")}}), emails ({{Glossary("SMTP")}}), and other applications.
