**Uniform Resource Locator** (**URL**) is a text string that specifies where a resource (such as a web page, image, or video) can be found on the Internet.

In the context of [HTTP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTTP), URLs are called "Web address" or "link". Your [browser](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Browser) displays URLs in its address bar, for example: `https://developer.mozilla.org` Some browsers display only the part of a URL after the "//", that is, the [Domain name](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Domain_name).

URLs can also be used for file transfer ([FTP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/FTP)), emails ([SMTP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/SMTP)), and other applications.
