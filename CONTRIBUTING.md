## Reviewing/Evaluating Online Content

Before evaluating or reviewing any content or online resource, ensure that you have made a copy of the [Review Google Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CRaejbYTLorucBXauv2Z-FEqXtYB5K1hdsZu7496YEc/copy). Once you've made a copy, update the title then click the `Share` button, change the `General Access` to `Anyone with the link` and select `Commenter` as the role. Once the review is finished, update the document and share the link with the `integration.io` staff. 

### Videos

- **Check for outdated content**. When reviewing videos, it's important to check whether the concepts explained or the content itself is outdated. If that's the case, make sure to accompany the video with relevant notes. Here's some examples:

  - In [this really nice introduction to the browser](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuSURHrZG6I) the `http` protocol is mentioned along with the default port `80`. These days the default protocol is `https` and the default port is `443`. We've left a comment reminding the viewers about this important distinction.

- **Always check the comments section** for more information and feedback from the community. For example, you can use a Chrome extension like [SummifyYT](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/summifyyt-summarize-youtu/mcjgidambippeaajehcfimmephgholco) to get a summary of all the submitted comments in a YouTube video.
