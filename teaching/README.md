## Important Concepts

### Dual-coding Theory & Picture Superiority Effect

Dual-coding theory is a theory of cognition that suggests that the mind processes information along two different channels; verbal, and visual. It was hypothesized by Allan Paivio of the University of Western Ontario in 1971. In developing this theory, Paivio used the idea that the formation of mental images aids learning through the picture superiority effect, which states that pictures and images are more likely to be remembered than are words. This effect has been demonstrated in numerous experiments using different methods. The Picture Superiority Effect has applications in education, where learners can structure a mental model when processing a picture initially so that no further model construction may be required for subsequent processing of a text.

Studies have shown that presenting picture before text is beneficial to students with low prior knowledge as it improves comprehension levels. According to Paivio, there are two ways a person could expand on learned material: verbal associations and imagery. Both imagery and verbal codes can be used when recalling information. **The ability to code a stimulus two different ways increases the chance of remembering** that item compared to if the stimulus was only coded one way.

Supporting evidence shows that memory for some verbal information is enhanced if a relevant visual is also presented or if the learner can imagine a visual image to go with the verbal information. Likewise, visual information can often be enhanced when paired with relevant verbal information, whether real-world or imagined.

Paivio's work has implications for literacy, visual mnemonics, idea generation, "Human performance technology", human factors, interface design, as well as the development of educational materials among others.
