    Answer: 

    1) Each day, you'll be given a new sli.do that relates to the topics of the daily content/material. This means, that the previous sli.do will be closed for questions.
    If you have any questions related to yesterday's topic, you can use today's sli.do and from now on, we'll try and keep the previous sli.do links open for more questions.

    2) No, as mentioned during our welcoming session, live Q&As for this week will happen on Wednesday and Friday.
