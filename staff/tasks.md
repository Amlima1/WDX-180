## MISC

### Complete unit testing and documentation pages for the tools

  Scripts found in `tools/` folder must be accompanied by several unit tests.

  At this point, only a handful of scripts contain unit tests. Check [the relevant file](../tools/README.md) to get more information about the tools and their testing status.

  If you feel ready to contribute, and it's the first time you are working on the testing of a tool, please reach out to the corresponding Project Manager for the tool before starting to work on the tests.

### Set up GitHub Actions to run housekeeping scripts (linting, etc.)
