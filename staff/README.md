```
Hello team <TEAM_NAME>!

You are now part of one of the 5 teams of the WDX-Intro course.
You will be working together as a team of 4 super-heros. :slightly_smiling_face:

Each group is named after a person that contributed (or still contributes) to programming and computer science.

First task of the team: find out why this group is named <TEAM_NAME>. ;)    
```

**TEAM_NAME:** Ada, Alan, Claude, Tim, Grace.

- **Share Progress Google Sheet** with student and ask them to create a personal copy and share the URL with their instructor(s) and mentor(s). Here are the steps:
  1. Open up the original Google Progress Spreadsheet, click the `Share` button and click the `Copy link` button on the bottom left.
  2. Replace the last part of the URL that you copied. For example if the links is something like this: `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1234567890/edit?usp=sharing` you should change it to `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1234567890/copy` (replacing the last part with `copy`)
  3. Share the URL with the student. They will be presented with a screen that says `"Would you like to make a copy of WDX - Progress Sheet?"`. They should click on the `Make a copy` button.
  4. After they have made a copy of the Spreadsheet, they should rename it to include their full name, e.g. from `Copy of WDX - Progress Sheet` to `Kostas Minaidis - WDX - Progress Sheet`.
  5. Next, they will have to click the `Share` button, go to the `General access` area at the bottom, click `Restricted` and change it to `Anyone with the link`. Then, change the permissions to the right from `Viewer` to `Commenter`.
  6. Lastly, click the `Copy link` button, and share the link with their instructor(s) and/or mentor(s).
