<!--after going  to the front page of The Mozilla 
    Developer Network, viewing the source and google 
    searched it, here is what I found in google search 
    "The MDN Web Docs site provides information about 
    Open Web technologies including HTML, CSS, and 
    APIs for both Web sites and progressive web apps.". 
    The only difference is the space between web and sites-->
