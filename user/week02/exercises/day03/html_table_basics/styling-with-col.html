<!--we can specify the information once, 
on a <col> element. <col> elements are specified 
inside a <colgroup> container just below the 
opening <table> tag. We could create 
the same effect as we see above by specifying 
our table as follows:-->
<table>
    <colgroup>
      <col />
      <col style="background-color: yellow" />
    </colgroup>
    <tr>
      <th>Data 1</th>
      <th>Data 2</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Calcutta</td>
      <td>Orange</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Robots</td>
      <td>Jazz</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <!--Effectively we are defining two "style columns", 
one specifying styling information for each column. 
We are not styling the first column, but we still have 
to include a blank <col> element â€” if we didn't, the styling 
would just be applied to the first column.

If we wanted to apply the styling information 
to both columns, we could just include one <col> element with 
a span attribute on it, like this:

<colgroup>
  <col style="background-color: yellow" span="2" />
</colgroup>

Just like colspan and rowspan, span takes a unitless number 
value that specifies the number of columns you want 
the styling to apply to.-->
