<!--There is one last feature we'll 
    tell you about in this article
     before we move on. HTML has a method
      of defining styling information for
       an entire column of data all in one
place — the <col> and <colgroup> elements. 
These exist because it can be a bit annoying 
and inefficient having to specify styling on 
columns — you generally have to specify your styling 
information on every <td> or <th> in the column, or 
use a complex selector such as :nth-child. To set other
properties you'll have to either style every <td> or <th> 
in the column, or use a complex selector such as :nth-child.-->
